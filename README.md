### git push -u origin main

Pushes the local `main` branch to the remote repository named `origin` and sets it as the default upstream branch.  
The `-u` (or `--set-upstream`) flag links the local branch to the remote branch, allowing future pushes and pulls to be executed simply with `git push` or `git pull` without specifying the branch name.

Pushes the local `main` branch to the remote repository and sets it as the upstream branch for future pushes and pulls.
